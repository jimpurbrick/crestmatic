crestmatic
==========

A matic project used to generate CREST documentation.

## Dependencies

To build this example you will need to install the following two node packages:

[Matic](https://github.com/mattyod/matic)

and

[Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade)

## Installation
Then you can download this repository with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mattyod/matic-draft4-example
```

## Building the example docs
Then simply navigate into the newly cloned example folder and run:

    matic

You should now have a new folder called 'web' within the sample project. Within this should be a file called index.html, open this with a browser and view the generated documentation.
