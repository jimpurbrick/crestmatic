        h2 Resources

        p.
          Things in the EVE universe are exposed as addressable
          resources with a canonical URI. A representation of a
          resource can be obtained by making an HTTP GET request to
          the resource URI. Resources may be updated by making PUT
          requests to their URI and removed by making DELETE requests
          to their URI.

        p.
          All resources are reachable from the root API entry point
          URI. Clients should not construct URIs, but instead follow
          URIs included in representations they have received. URIs
          may be stored as bookmarks, shared in IMs, sent as emails
          and published on web sites. CCP will endevour to support
          URIs as permalinks, but client applications should be able
          to cope with URIs becoming invalid as the API evolves and
          resources may be served from different locations just as web
          browsers cope with broken links.

        h2 Representations

        p.
          Resources are represented as hypermedia documents which
          link to related resources. The structure of representations
          are described by media types. Clients specify the
          representation they would like to received using the Accept
          header of their request and specify which representations
          they are sending in the Content-Type header.

        p.
          Representations may be extended to add new relationships
          and functionality, so clients must ignore all extra data
          they receive. Representations will never rename or remove
          attributes.

        p.
          Where renaming or removing attributes is required to
          support new functionality, a new version of the
          representation will be defined as a new media type and the
          old representation will continue to be supported for as long
          as possible. The newest version of a representation will be
          served by default to ensure that new clients are developed
          using the newest representations. Clients that are widely
          distributed and not automatically updated should always
          supply Accept headers if they rely on the structure of
          representations.

        p.
          Representations are formatted as JSON objects containing
          name/value pairs and nested objects and arrays. Some
          name/value pairs are optional, meaning that they may be
          omitted by senders when not applicable. Some name/value
          pairs have default values which will be used when a value is
          not provided.

        h2 Authorization

        p.
          Requests to non-public parts of the API are made on behalf
          of a character. Client applications are further restricted
          by the set of scopes a player has allowed the application to
          use on behalf of a character. When making a request to a
          non-public part of the API, client applications must supply
          an OAuth 2 token granted by login.eveonline.com in the
          Authorization header. If the character is not allowed to
          make the request, or the token does not have the correct
          scopes, the request will be denied.

        h2 Localization

        p.
          Clients may specify the languages they would like to
          receive responses in by providing the Accept-Language header
          with their requests.
